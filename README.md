<br/>The Github repository mainly includes neural network definition, training and evaluation process. 
<br/>***Figures***: Store a comparison of the original and DMP generated tracks 
<br/>***Imednet***: Stores the source code for models and some utilities such as evaluation methods 
<br/>***Notebooks***: Test the Notebooks with trained models and data 
<br/>***Scripts***: the py file that stores the training procedure 
<br/>***Models***: Stores the trained model files 
<br/>Because of the limitation of large files' uploading, if you want to redo the experiment, you should create ***Models*** folder to store the experimental data. Here is the data set download method used in this paper: I uploaded the data/ and models/ directories to https://portal.ijs.si/nextcloud/s/mnp2DD7qCYzyPd5
